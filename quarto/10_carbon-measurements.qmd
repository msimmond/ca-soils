***Total carbon*** (TC) measures the total carbon in soil, which is predominantly soil organic carbon (SOC). SOC is a major component of SOM that drives the soil food web, serving as energy for microbial and other biological activity. It also plays a major role in other soil physical and chemical properties, such as aggregation and nutrient availability, respectively. It is derived from amendments, decomposing plant/root materials, macrofauna, etc. Soil inorganic carbon (TIC) is the fraction of TC that is formed from the soil parent material and the reaction of soil minerals with atmospheric CO2. TIC is primarily found in the soil as carbonates.  

Total carbon was measured via combustion, in which a soil sample is heated to a high temperature (min. 950°F) in order to convert the inorganic and organic portions of the soil into gases which are captured and measured by an infrared (IR) detector.

***Soil Organic Matter*** (SOM) is the portion of soils composed of animal, plant, and microbial matter in various stages of decomposition. It excludes soil minerals, air, and water. SOM underlies many of the benefits and ecosystem services that soils provide. It has a large impact on almost all other soil properties and is often used as a primary indicator of soil health. SOM is composed of approximately 58% organic carbon. The remaining portion of SOM includes other essential plant nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur. SOM content varies by inherent soil and landscape properties such as texture, mineralogy, precipitation, and temperature. It is also greatly impacted by management. However, SOM can be slow to increase as the result of management. To learn more about how to increase SOM, read about the NRCS principles of building soil health.

The SOM results in this assessment are calculated values derived by multiplying total carbon (TC) x 2, following Pribyl 2010. The international standard calculation is to multiple SOC x 1.724, so these numbers might be higher than you are used to seeing.

***Soil Respiration*** (also referred to as “Potential Carbon Mineralization”) measures microbial activity via release of carbon dioxide (CO₂) from dry soil after being rewetted in laboratory conditions. Carbon mineralization is the process in which microbes produce CO₂ as they decompose SOM. During this process, other nutrients are also mineralized and made available to the crop for uptake. Soils with lower SOM will have inherently lower MinC, while compacted soils may not provide adequate aeration for the mineralization process. In this assessment, respiration was measured after 24 hrs and is reported as micrograms of CO₂ per gram of soil per day. 

***Permanganate Oxidizable Carbon*** (POXC, also referred to as “Active Carbon”) is a measurement of soil carbon that is hypothesized to be influenced by changes in management (compared to SOM, which may not show changes in management for many years). POXC concentrations are associated with practices that lead to long-term organic matter storage, and may represent a portion of SOM that is from plant material, including compounds related to plant defense. In this assessment, POXC was measured by exposing dry soil to potassium permanganate, which is a strong oxidizer, and then measuring the color change of a soil solution as a result of the oxidation process.
