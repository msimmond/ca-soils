## Soil Health Indicators

Soil health is defined as the continued capacity of a soil to function as a living ecosystem that supports plants, animals, and humans. It also recognizes the living nature of soils and the importance of soil microorganisms. Healthy soils can provide wildlife habitat, support biodiversity, reduce the effects of climate change, filter air and water, increase crop productivity and food security, and ensure thriving rural economies.
The below table describes: 1. The name of the soil health indicators included in this report; 2. What function each indicator helps measure in your soil; and 3. Whether you want the measured value to be higher (more is better), lower (less is better), or in the middle (optimal range); Our understanding of these indicators is rapidly evolving as researchers measure them in diverse soils, cropping systems, and climates.

<!-- ## Soil Science 101 -->

<!-- A crucial part of the soil health journey is measuring changes in your soil and understanding how to interpret those measurements. We can measure soil health with a range of indicators describing a soilâ€™s physical, chemical, and biological properties, which can relate to important soil functions. Each indicator measures a different property of the soil and can be affected differently by management. -->

### Qualities of a Healthy Agricultural Soil

-   GOOD DRAINAGE, MINIMAL FLOODING: soil physical structure that allows water to move efficiently is key to healthy soil.
-   RESISTANT TO DEGRADATION: related to good drainage, a healthy soil will have good aggregation that resists water and wind erosion and runoff.
-   THRIVING SOIL LIFE: these include both micro- and macroorganisms in the soil which help to build healthy soil and require soil pore space and organic matter additions to thrive and facilitate nutrient cycling.
-   NO RESIDUAL CHEMICALS: efficient nutrient cycling and avoiding the accumulation of toxins that could harm a crop, such as salts.
-   HEALTHY, PRODUCTIVE CROPS: this is a result of the qualities listed above that support crop growth with minimal inputs and with minimal disease.
