Thank you again for your participation in our project, and for your patience as we prepared
these results. The next phase of our work will be to analyze which indicators are most sensitive and informative of the management and performance differences that farmers describe. We will share these results with you as we develop them in fall 2025. We also plan to continue refining our understanding of the efficacy and sensitivity of soil health indicators in various cropping systems of California and to continue sharing that information with farmers.
