## Overview

Introducing {casoils}: an R package for California soil health data visualization and reporting needs. {casoils} provides an enhanced version of the {soils} package with dynamic grouping capabilities for treatment comparisons and automated report generation.

{casoils} is based on and extends the {soils} package, which was developed by the Washington State Department of Agriculture and Washington State University as part of the Washington Soil Health Initiative. This California-specific adaptation provides enhanced functionality while preserving the core methodology of the original package.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Grouping Support**: New `set_dynamic_scales()` function for flexible treatment comparisons
- **California-Specific Adaptations**: Tailored for UCANR and California Farm Demonstration Network
- **Enhanced Visualization**: Improved plotting capabilities with dynamic symbol and color assignment
- **Automated Reporting**: Streamlined report generation for soil health assessments

## Requirements

The report template uses [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/), which is the next-generation version of R Markdown.

We assume you're using [RStudio v2022.07](https://dailies.rstudio.com/version/2022.07.2+576.pro12/) or later for editing and previewing Quarto documents. We **strongly recommend** you use the [latest release of RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) for support of all Quarto features.

To render Microsoft Word (MS Word) documents, you must have MS Word installed and activated.

## Installation

Install from GitHub:

``` r
# Install from GitHub
remotes::install_github("msimmond/ca-soils")
```

Or using {pak}:

``` r
# Install pak if not already installed
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install("msimmond/ca-soils")
```

Load the package:

``` r
library(casoils)
```

## Usage

{casoils} was developed to work 'out of the box' so you can immediately install and render an example report. The package includes all the functionality of the original {soils} package plus enhanced dynamic grouping capabilities.
