Description: An adaptation and extension of the 'soils' R package originally
    developed by the Washington State Department of Agriculture. Provides
    California-specific functionality for soil health reporting and adds
    new methods, including `set_dynamic_scales()` for dynamic grouping.
    This package preserves and builds upon the methodology of 'soils',
    while tailoring reports and utilities for UCANR and the California Farm
    Demonstration Network context.
